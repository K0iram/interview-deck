<h3>Section 1 - Javascript</h3>

  ### Question #1
  <Layout>
    <Appear>
      <p>What is the difference between == and === ?</p>
      <p>
        === is scrict equality. Both sides of the operator must be the same
        type to be considered equal
      </p>
    </Appear>
  </Layout>

  ### Question #2
  <Layout>
    <Appear>
      <p>What is a Closure?</p>
      <p>
        A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

    </Appear>

  ### Question #3
  <Layout>
    <Appear>
      <p>What is a pure function?</p>
      <p>
        A pure function is a function which:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Given the same input, will always return the same output.</li>
        <li>Produces no side effects.</li>
      </ul>
    </Appear>
  </Layout>

  ### Question #4
  <Layout>
    <Appear>
      <p>What is a Promise?</p>
      <p>
        A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that it’s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.
      </p>
    </Appear>
  </Layout>

  ### Question #5
  <Layout>
    <Appear>
    <p>What’s the Difference Between Class & Prototypal Inheritance?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Class Inheritance: A class is like a blueprint — a description of the object to be created.
        Classes inherit from classes and create subclass relationships: hierarchical class taxonomies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prototypal Inheritance: A prototype is a working object instance.
      Objects inherit directly from other objects.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </Appear>
